Pixie: a Python CSS Preprocessor

Pixie is a Python CSS preprocessor that allows for CSS to benefit from good
programming practices; Pixie lets a programmer define his or her
variables within a CSS file just like in Python. Instead of calculating every
width and offset by hand, Pixie does it automatically; Pixie is to CSS as an assembler is to assembly code.

usage: pixie [-h] [-v] filename

positional arguments:
  filename    The file to parse

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -v          Keeps the Pixie data in the output CSS file



Future Updates:

Provide a linking mechanism so that variables can be defined in an
extenal Python file rather than directly in the .pixie file.
